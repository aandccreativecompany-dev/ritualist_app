# Prakriyā

*(formerly "Ritualist")*

A daily ritual and manifestation practice app for Android — priorities,
habits, a mantra each morning, journaling, and reminders that reach you when
you're too busy to open the app. Now also covers finance (wallet, budget,
savings), health, relationships, and a shareable vision board.

Built and maintained by A&C Creative Company.

## Status

**v0.4.1** — current release, distributed as a signed APK on
[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/aandccreativecompany-dev/Prakriya/releases).
Local-first: the app works with no network. Signing in is optional and only
adds a cloud backup of your data under your own Google account — there is
still no paywall and no forced account.

## What's in the app

**Core / daily practice**
- Dashboard: greeting, today's mantra, quick stats, and shortcuts to every
  section, plus a bottom nav bar — each section is its own full screen
  (no more swipe-carousel repeating the header on every page)
- Home card stack: date, mantra, top three priorities, habits — reorderable
  and hideable from Settings or the first-run quiz
- Habit streaks and a five-week history grid, with a tappable calendar
- Three daily local reminders: 7:30am mantra + priorities, a 1pm check that
  only fires if something's still open, a 9pm close-the-day
- Onboarding: welcome → a short quiz that sets a preset → the module picker.
  Runs once; retakeable from Settings any time
- Scripting (outcome engineering): write the outcome you want as if it
  already happened, with entry timestamps
- Quote of the day: today's mantra, full-screen and shareable — mantra bank
  of 153+ entries, shuffled with no-repeat-until-exhausted rotation
- Weekly and monthly goals
- Weekly momentum review: priorities finished and habit check-ins over the
  last 7 days
- Evening reflection / journaling: short prompts, locked behind an optional
  PIN with biometric unlock on top

**Finance**
- Wallet: editable monthly/weekly budget (scroll-to-select amount picker or
  manual entry) with a live spent-vs-budget progress bar
- Spending tracker with editable entries (tap to edit, not just delete) and
  a Need/Want budget calculator that pulls actual spend live from it
- Savings & investments tracking across emergency fund, stocks, mutual
  funds, gold, fixed deposits, PPF/EPF, real estate, crypto and other —
  running totals per type with logged, noted contributions
- Indian Rupee currency throughout

**Health & relationships**
- Skin Health tips (grounded, practical — no external form/webview)
- Audible-bell exercise timer
- Relationships & Connection: a "who to reach out to" tracker — set a
  check-in cadence per person, see who's overdue, log a check-in in one tap
- Mind map notes

**Vision board**
- Grid of tiles with per-tile decorative frames (polaroid, torn paper,
  washi tape, drop shadow), photo colour-grading presets (warm, dreamy,
  B&W), whimsical shapes (cloud, flower, arch, blob, plus boxes/circles/
  stars/hearts), and board-wide background themes (cork, linen, gradient,
  midnight)
- Shared vision boards: create one and get a short code, or join one with a
  code someone shared with you — anyone signed in with the code can add a
  point (text-only; no photo sync yet)

**Platform / polish**
- Optional Google sign-in with Firebase-backed cloud backup — sync is
  opt-in, last-write-wins, and nothing else in the app depends on it
- Android home-screen widget (habits checklist, top priority, and/or
  today's mantra — user-selectable in Settings)
- Copy-and-paste backup, for when you don't want an account
- Light and dark, following the phone, overridable in Settings
- Edge-to-edge display, tab-switch fade transitions, haptic feedback on
  habit toggles, tab switches, and saves
- "About us" screen (website/Instagram/YouTube links, moved out of the
  in-app footer)

## Not in this build

The paywall is designed (see `design/`) but deliberately not built: the app
is free of charge for now, per the product decisions in the design handoff.
It needs Google Play Billing product IDs to wire up and is future work, not
a bug. (Sign-in *is* built — see Platform / polish above.)

## Stack

- Flutter (Dart) — one codebase, Android first
- Local storage first (`shared_preferences`): the app works with no network
- Firebase (Auth, Cloud Firestore) + Google Sign-In for the optional
  cloud-backup and shared-vision-board features
- Local scheduled notifications for reminders (no push infrastructure)
- Android home-screen widget via `home_widget`
- Distribution: an APK on GitHub Releases (see `docs/RELEASING.md`); Play
  Store submission is future work

## Getting started

```
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Requires Flutter with the Android SDK. Run `flutter doctor` and clear every
warning before starting. There's no `android/` folder committed — see
"Building" below. Cloud-backup and shared-board features need a Firebase
project wired up (`google-services.json`); the rest of the app works
without one.

## Building

You don't need Flutter installed to get an APK:

- **Quick/debug build**: Actions tab → **Build APK (debug, manual)** → **Run
  workflow**. Downloads as a build artifact from the run page. No signing
  secrets required — this is what most contributors want.
- **Signed release**: push a `v*` tag. The **Release APK** workflow builds a
  signed APK and drafts a GitHub Release, but only once the repo has
  `KEYSTORE_BASE64`, `KEYSTORE_PASSWORD`, `KEY_PASSWORD` and `KEY_ALIAS`
  secrets set (Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions).

Both workflows generate `android/` fresh via `flutter create` and layer
`android_overrides/AndroidManifest.xml` (and the home-screen widget's native
provider/layout) on top — the repo deliberately holds no Gradle wrapper. See
`docs/RELEASING.md` for the full release process and
`docs/FINDING_BUILD_ERRORS.md` if a run fails.
